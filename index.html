                        Automobile accidents describe among the leading causes of death in developed countries. There
                        are also many victims on the side of adolescents and young adults, especially males. Road
                        accidents are considered an epidemic of the twentieth century because they claim the lives of
                        many people each year. The causes are to be found in speeding, driving while intoxicated or
                        under the influence of psychoactive substances, failure to comply with or absence of safety
                        provisions, distraction at the wheel due to the use of mobile phones, dangerous road
                        infrastructure and non-compliance with the Highway Code. The Kingdoms are translated as one of
                        the safest countries in terms of road safety. They have achieved this through the combination of
                        regulation, enforcement and education. Our data visualization project is based on road accident
                        data in the United Kingdom between 2005 and 2016. The object of our study is to highlight the
                        number of accident cases through two graphs, one which shows the evolution between 2005 and 2016
                        according to gender and the other with a catre that shows the different cities have occurred
                        accidents.
